## Advanced Features

### 1. Advanced Mathematical Functions

The TeluguFusion language now supports a range of advanced mathematical functions, enabling developers to perform complex calculations with ease. These functions include:

- **లాగరిథం (Logarithm):** Computes the logarithm of a given number.
- **ఎక్స్పొనెన్షియల్ (Exponential):** Calculates the exponential value of a number.
- **ట్యాన్ (Tangent):** Determines the tangent of an angle.
- **మ్యాట్రిక్స్_గుణకారం (Matrix Multiplication):** Performs multiplication of matrices.
- **మ్యాట్రిక్స్_కలయిక (Matrix Addition):** Adds two matrices together.

### 2. Agent-Based Programming Structures

The language introduces agent-based programming structures, allowing developers to model complex agent behaviors. These structures include:

- **ఏజెంట్_సృష్టించు (Create Agent):** Initializes a new agent with specified attributes.
- **ఏజెంట్_ప్రవర్తన (Agent Behavior):** Defines the behavior of an agent in response to stimuli.
- **ఏజెంట్_సంవేదన (Agent Perception):** Models the perception capabilities of an agent.
- **ఏజెంట్_నిర్ణయం (Agent Decision):** Facilitates decision-making processes for agents.
