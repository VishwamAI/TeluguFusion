# Feature Planning for TeluguFusion

## Auto-Suggestions
- **Objective**: Provide code suggestions as users type, enhancing coding efficiency.
- **Approach**: Implement a language server protocol (LSP) to analyze code context and suggest completions.
- **Integration**: Connect with the existing lexer and parser to understand code structure.

## Auto-Coding
- **Objective**: Automatically generate code snippets based on user prompts or predefined templates.
- **Approach**: Use machine learning models trained on Telugu code datasets to generate code.
- **Integration**: Embed within the IDE or editor supporting TeluguFusion.

## AI Reinforcement Learning
- **Objective**: Optimize code execution and resource management using reinforcement learning techniques.
- **Approach**: Implement RL algorithms to learn and adapt to code execution patterns.
- **Integration**: Interface with the compiler and runtime environment to adjust execution strategies.

## Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation
- **Objective**: Enhance execution speed by compiling code at runtime.
- **Current State**: Partial implementation using LLVM in `compiler.py`.
- **Next Steps**: Expand JIT capabilities to support more complex code structures and optimizations.

## General Considerations
- Ensure compatibility with existing codebase and Telugu language features.
- Maintain performance and efficiency across all new implementations.
- Collaborate with stakeholders to refine feature requirements and priorities.
