# Telugu Programming Language Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Telugu programming language, including syntax rules, usage guidelines, and practical examples.

## Overview

The Telugu programming language is designed to be intuitive and natural for Telugu speakers. It supports a wide range of features, including advanced mathematical operations, agent-based programming structures, web development capabilities, database integration, concurrency, and localization features.

## Basic Syntax and Data Types

- **Integer (చర)**: Represents whole numbers.
- **String (పదం)**: Represents sequences of characters.
- **Boolean (నిజం/అబద్ధం)**: Represents true or false values.

## Control Structures

- **If-Else (యెడల/లేక)**: Conditional execution of code blocks.
- **For Loop (కోసం)**: Iterates over a range of values.
- **While Loop (చేయు)**: Repeats a block of code while a condition is true.

## Functions and Methods

- **Function Definition and Invocation**: Define reusable blocks of code and invoke them as needed.
- **Recursion and Reusability**: Support for recursive function calls and code reusability.

## Object-Oriented Programming

- **Classes and Objects**: Define custom data types and create instances.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Support for class hierarchies and polymorphic behavior.

## Core Libraries

- **Math (గణితం)**: Provides mathematical functions and constants.
- **String Manipulation (పదం నిర్వహణ)**: Functions for processing and manipulating strings.
- **File Input/Output (ఫైల్ ఇన్పుట్/అవుట్‌పుట్)**: Read from and write to files.
- **Data Structures (డేటా నిర్మాణాలు)**: Support for lists, dictionaries, and other data structures.

## Advanced Features

- **Concurrency (సమాంతరత)**: Support for concurrent execution of code.
- **Web Development (వెబ్ అభివృద్ధి)**: Tools and libraries for building web applications.
- **Database Integration (డేటాబేస్ సమీకరణ)**: Connect and interact with databases.

## Practical Examples

```telugu
చర సంఖ్య = 10
చేపాయిపిండి(సంఖ్య)

యెడల (సంఖ్య > 5) {
    చేపాయిపిండి("సంఖ్య పెద్దది 5 కంటే")
} లేక {
    చేపాయిపిండి("సంఖ్య చిన్నది లేదా సమానం 5కి")
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. **How do I run a Telugu program?**
   - Use the TeluguFusion interpreter or compiler to execute `.tel` files.

2. **Where can I find more examples?**
   - Check the `examples/` directory in the TeluguFusion repository for additional code samples.
